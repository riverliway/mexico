# How to turn on the hot water heater

1. Remove the medium gray outer casing 
2. Remove the light gray inner casing
3. Ensure the yellow knob which connects the pipe to the wall by the sink is pointing towards the wall
   * Use the cresent wrench in the utility kitchen draw under the microwave next to the balcony 
4. Move the red dial so it is in the middle (the triangle pointing towards the dial is the marker)
5. Rotate the red pilot lighter so it can be pressed all the way down
6. Press and hold the red pilot light to get the gas flowing, do not release
7. Click the green striker button which faces the window
   * It may take several strikes since the gas must be flowing through the line
   * Wait for about 5-10 seconds between strikes until the flame is lit
8. Once the flame is lit, keep pressing the red pilot light for a few seconds
9. Slowly release the red pilot light until the rest of the burner lights up
10. Rotate the red pilot light until it cannot be pressed down anymore
11. Adjust the red dial to preferred temp, middle usually works just fine for me
12. Get light gray inner casing back into place, usually have to insert the end first and rotate until horizontal
13. Get medium gray outer casing back into place
